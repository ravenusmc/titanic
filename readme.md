# Titanic
## Intro

The purpose of this project is to work with flask so that I may better
understand it. At the same time, I will be using Pandas to look at some data
about the Titanic. The data that I have came, as usual, from Kaggle. The URL is
the following: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data. What is interesting is that
this data set was made for machine learning to try and find out something about
those passengers who either survived or died on the titanic.  

This project, at its most basic level, will be a few web pages where a user may
select certain conditions about who lived or died and see what comes back.
