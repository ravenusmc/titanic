# Titanic
## Intro

The purpose of this project is to work with flask so that I may better
understand it. At the same time, I will be using Pandas to look at some data
about the Titanic. The data that I have came, as usual, from Kaggle. The URL is
the following: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data. What is interesting is that
this data set was made for machine learning to try and find out something about
those passengers who either survived or died on the titanic.

I will also mention that this project will be using a lot of lorem ipsum since
I want to focus on coding and not really looking up information about the titanic.  

This project, at its most basic level, will be a few web pages where a user may
select certain conditions about who lived or died and see what comes back.

Finally, I have created a basic user registration system using a Mongo DB for
backend. I have decided, in this project, not to use Bcrypt to hide the passwords.
That, I believe, I will save for my next project.
